# YouTube Live Chat App

This is a Node.js project that lets you view YouTube live chat from a given video ID.
NOTE: if you want to use transparent theme, rename main-transparent-support.js to main.js

## Requirements

- Node.js installed

## Setup Instructions

1. Download all project files into a folder.
2. Open your **Terminal** in that folder.
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install electron@latest --save-dev
```

This installs Electron into the project folder.

4. Execute `run.ps1` (or `run.sh` on Linux or Mac).

The first time you run it, you will see:

```
Downloading Electron binary...
```

Wait until it reaches 100% before continuing.

## Setting up script

All you really need is the video ID and max messages count in config.json.
